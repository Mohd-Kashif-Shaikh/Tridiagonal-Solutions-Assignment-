Tridiagonal Solution Data Science Interview Task :- 

Problem statement: 
Pharmaceutical drug and review data is provided. Build a model to predict a drug name based on the review given. Also answer the given questions using the provided dataset. Use Python. During the interview, you are expected to share the python code (preferably Jupyter notebook) code containing your answers. 

Dataset: The dataset under consideration consists of two primary components train and test. These are intended for use in a supervised machine learning (NLP) task.

The train dataset contains textual information that is related to review of the drug.

Columns: 
1.	Unique Id – A unique identifier reference for each entry in the dataset 
2.	Drug Name – This contains the name of the drug
3.	Condition – Gives the information about the patient condition 
4.	Review – contains the review about the drug

The test dataset contains only information about the review which you can used for making inferences
Train the Model using train dataset and predict the result on test dataset. You can evaluate your final model based on the result provided in the ‘model_evaluation.csv’ where ground truth is given.

Q1): What preprocessing steps would you perform on the train dataset before using it for modelling.

Q2) Are there any missing values in the dataset? If yes, what is the nature of missing values and how might this affect model performance. What are some techniques to mitigate this issue.

Q4) Do you see any potential features in the review column that could be useful for predicting the drug name and condition.

Q5) Can you provide some statistics and visualizations to summarize the distribution of categories (drug name)

Q6) Are there classes which are underrepresented or overrepresented? How might this skew the model’s prediction.

Q7) What are some techniques that can be used to address this? Does the model performance improve after incorporating such strategies.

Q8) What Modelling strategy would you consider for predicting the drug name from the dataset and why.

Q9) How can we assess model robustness (Cross Validation Strategies).

Q10) What evaluation metrics would you use to assess the performance of your model.

Q11) What considerations would you have for deploying this model in a production environment.
